Manchester's own Homoelectric are packing their suitcases and setting sail for the Big Smoke, as the fam move outta their Mancunian gutter and into Bethnal Green's Metropolis for a month-long summer holiday in July. \n\nThe Manchester underground queer collective will be hosting the first ever Metropolis month-long residency since the transformed East London str!p club's inception ‚Äî and they will be raising hell across every Saturday in July. Alongside the flags and the dirty outfits, they have stuffed their suitcases with an extended Mancunian crew and will be bringing their dysfunctional disco on tour. \n\nThey will be bringing you four non-stop exotic discos for homos, lesbos, don't knows, kings, queens, trans, pans, queers and their straight peers. That's four raves for the late-night disenfranchised, the refuse-to-be-categorised, and for the dirty ba3tars3 who know that music is LIFE. So that's six hours of music, melodrama, and muck, every Saturday in July. + over 12 DJs including their Homoelectric residents and Homoelectric regulars to be revealed on the line-up as they go‚Ä¶ \n\nInto the music melting pot each week, they will throw a hot sweaty homo-made mix of disco, house, techno, garage, sleaze and dirty basslines with no pomp, no snobbery and no pretension! Sexual orientation and music genres are irrelevant on the Homoelectric dancefloors. \n\nRemember the motto: love is the message, music is the life, Homoelectric is for the late night disenfranchised. A Queer party for all. \n\nThis is going to be a vacation to remember. See you at the Villa (aka Metropolis) this July!",

Drawing inspiration from the queer and femme-led club nights that paved the way, Disco Monde thrives on the fusion of genres and cultures, embracing a musical journey that knows no boundaries. Refusing to be confined by labels, they believe that when it comes to music, nothing is off-limits. At Disco Monde, the dance floor becomes a celebration of diversity, where the sounds of the world unite in a shared rhythm of joy and freedom.\n\nThey have been booked to play at popular venues, such as Soho House, The Jago, Grow Hackney. They also played Brighton Pride 2024, Twist Festival 2025 and have been featured on Loose FM and Foundation FM.\n\nDJ AC:\nDJ AC spins bassy global club goodness inspired by her upbringing across Aotearoa, Taiwan, and London. Expect a queer flow through the polyrhythmic sounds of the afro and latinx diaspora infused with tasty edits from afrobeats to UKG.\n\nDR. MAZZA:\nDr. Mazza - Marie-Ermelinda Mayassi is a Paris-born, Congolese DJ, community curator and NGO founder currently based in London. Based in East London, Dr. Mazza is a co-founder of the Echoes Collective, a member of the Original Soundsystem collective and a new resident at Oroko Radio.\n\nDr. Mazza seeks to channel her unconditional love for the dancefloor by sharing her favourite mix of genres, including an eclectic range of electronic music from alternative techno to GQOM and jersey club, inspired by her French, Congolese and British roots. You can explore her musical universe through her performances on NTS, foundation fm and keep hush. Find her behind the DJ booth near you.\n\n≈åKAMI:\nNamed after the Japanese word for wolf, ≈åKAMI is the side project of artist Kamƒ´; a space where she channels her fundamental belief that sound is a sacred vessel through which communities of colour can connect in solidarity and find true liberation in the dance.\n\nWhile ≈åKAMI has a deep affinity for the atmospheric and sub-heavy frequencies of dubstep, grime, drill and jungle you can often find her playfully switching gear into rich club sounds from across the world such as dancehall, bhangra, gqom, Asian dance sub-genres, baile funk and ballroom - with plenty of attitude.\n\nINDA FLO:\ninda Flo is a disc jockey, radio host, and event promoter pushing and pulling up on the underground club scene to bend and blend cultural sounds in her stomping ground of Global Bass, Techno, Percussive Club, Electronic, and World.\n\nHer sets guarantee a nonstop high and bouncy energy that reach across waters and beyond borders of Asia, Africa, Latin America, The Middle East, The Caribbean, Europe, and the diasporic world. Expect to move and sweat to heavy basslines, relentless rhythms, and certified bangers - accompanied with her signature sound of euphoric instrumentals ranging from brass, percussion, strings, wind, and vocal melodies.\n\nHer mission? To remind the world that every cultural sound, identity, and expression gets to co-exist.\n\nSet in COVEN ‚Äì East London's new queer bar and arts space ‚Äì MAJOTACHI is more than a club night. It's a portal. Come ready to sweat, chant, bounce, and be transformed.\n\nPlease note the event is taking upstairs at Coven (above Fabwick) which is currently not wheelchair accessible.",
